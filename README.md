# üîç Advanced RAG System with Dual Backend Architecture for medical diagnosis

This project implements a large-scale, production-ready **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system, designed for modularity, scalability, and cloud-native deployment.

## üß† Overview

An advanced RAG system integrated within a **RESTful API**, using a **multi-container architecture** to maintain clean separation of concerns:

- **FastAPI**: Implements the RAG engine logic in its own container to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- **Django**: Handles user management and authentication, along with PostgreSQL for persistent storage.
- **Angular**: Frontend application for interacting with and displaying backend data.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database connected to the Django backend.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture
+----------------------+ +---------------------+ \
| Angular UI | <----> | FastAPI (RAG API) | <----> | Django (volume) | \
| Django (Users/Auth) | <----> | PostgreSQL DB | \
+----------------------+ +----------------------+


## üöÄ Features

- üîÅ **Dual Backend**: Django (auth, admin) & FastAPI (RAG inference)
- üê≥ **Full Dockerization**: All components containerized for reproducibility
- ‚öôÔ∏è **CI/CD-Ready**: Jenkins pipelines configured for continuous integration & deployment
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Deployment**: Deployment targeted to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- üìà **Monitoring (soon)**: Prometheus & Grafana support for live metrics and observability
- üß† **LLM Extensions**: Actively integrating advanced language model features

## üì¶ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI, Django, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Orchestration**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins
- **Cloud**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **Monitoring** (upcoming): Prometheus, Grafana

## üìå Development Status

> üõ†Ô∏è Currently focused on stability improvements and LLM feature integration.  
> ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud deployment to AKS in progress.  
> üìä Monitoring stack will be added soon.
