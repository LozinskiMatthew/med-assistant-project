I should add another component -> "doctor" withint the dashboard, so I will be
able to speak with rag, and another component relevant documents, in which patient
would be able to save his/her docs so rag may interact with their relative representations.

RAG will have it's own common docs
In future I should divide users to patients and doctors

Instead of simple Logout button, I should add a profile button, where the delete, and logout options will be available,
and generally after a while JWT will expire, so I should add a refresh token functionality and I should prohibit access to
page without JWT.

Also I should create a  button where I can add .pdfs to make RAG(doctor) be able to analyze them.

RAG doc should be on the dashboard page.

In future I'd love to add  docter and patient accounts division.

Black theme should be added, with easy switching.
ToDo: Remove Date field from note model.
